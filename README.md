<h1>Data Manipulation within Splunk</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Data processing, parsing, and manipulation are important for getting meaningful insights from machine-generated data. Having the right skills is very useful when responding to security threats, investigating incidents, and monitoring system health. In this lab, I will be covering how events are parsed in Splunk, the importance of conf files, how to extract custom fields, and how to identify timestamps within an event log.
<br />
<br />
In this scenario, we are working as a SOC analyst who needs to ingest some logs for a client. Splunk needs to be configured to parse and transform the logs, we have the following issues: Event breaking, multi-line events, Masking, and extracting custom fields. We will be addressing these issues within the terminal on our VM.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Splunk</b> 
- <b>SPL</b>
- <b>linux CLI</b>
- <b>Splunk stanzas</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Linux Virtual Machine</b>

<h2>Configuration Files and their Purpuse</h2>

- <b>Inputs.conf - Defines data inputs and how to collect data from sources.</b> 
- <b>Props.conf - Specifies parsing rules for different sourcetypes to extract fields and define field extractions.</b>
- <b>Transforms.conf - Allows you to define field transformations and enrichments on indexed policies, and access control.</b>
- <b>Indexes.conf - Manages the configuration of indexes in Splunk, including storage, retention policies, and access control.</b>
- <b>Outpus.conf - Specifies the destination and settings for sending data  to various outputs, such as remote Splunk instances or third-party systems.</b>
- <b>Authentication.conf - Manages authentication settings and user authentication methods.</b>

<h2>Lab Walk-through</h2>

<p align="center">
1. Now that we understand the different types of conf files, let's spin up Splunk. First lets navigate to the directory where Splunk is located and run the following command to spin up the instance with root privileges. After that runs you should be able to access Splunk via the web browser: <br/>

<br />
<br />
2. Once you are in the web interface, we are going to create a simple app. Splunk apps are pre-packaged software modules or extensions that enhance the functionality of Splunk. On the home page you can see the available apps by clicking the settings gear icon to the right of where it says “Apps”:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
3. To create an app, we can select create an app in the top right corner: <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/nDEni3W.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
4. Then we just fill out the details of the app we are creating:  <br/>

 <br />
<br />
5. We can see that our app has been created and can check to see if any logs have been generated by clicking “launch app”:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/46NLEdH.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/><br />
<br />
6. There is no activity yet, so we need to generate logs. :  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/rPbzOFK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/><br />
<br />
7. To look at our App directory we can navigate to opt/splunk/etc/apps. Here we can see our DataApp and other Splunk apps available to us:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/Lyn7iWZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/><br />
<br />
8. We can also see what A Splunk app directory contains by looking into the DataApps directory. The key directories/files include app.conf, bin, default,and local:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/23ma72V.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
9. The bin directory holds custom scripts and binaries required by the app. Let’s head to the bin directory and add a python script. Create a script using nano and save it. Note of the full path to this script for later.:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/6RFKnyk.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
10. In our default directory let’s add and configure inputs.conf file using nano:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/4iIHmnn.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
11. After configuring our inputs.conf file, let's restart our Splunk instance using the following command:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/0MfCcLo.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
12. Now if we go back to the Splunk interface and check out our app we can see the script is pulling into our app!:  <br/>

 <br />
<br />
13. Next, we are going to configure vpn logs to generate some events. Copy the VPNlogs script from the download’s directory to the bin directory on the DataApp we created earlier. Write the following into the inputs.conf and then restart Splunk:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/PKeYy8h.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
14. Loading up our Splunk instance and searching for our new logs we can see that the VPN logs are pulling in with an issue. Splunk is unable to determine the boundaries of each event and considers multiple events as one. To fix this we can edit the props.conf file and use regex to determine the end of each event:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/7EaIqin.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
15. Let’s create a Props.conf file by using nano and adding the following lines and then restart Splunk to put those changes into effect:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/x6XLeJW.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
16. A quick search will now show us that our logs are pulling in correctly and the props.conf file is working perfectly:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/0XGpt3m.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
17. Next, we are going to parse events that contain multiple lines. Start by copying over the Authentication_logs from our downloads folder and adding these lines to the inputs.conf file:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/bleO1i7.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
18. To find the file that was downloaded we can traverse through Mallory’s user files. After looking at the downloads folder we found an interesting file named important HR information. Taking the hash that is generated by Splunk and searching for it on Virus Total we can see that it is indeed the malicious file we are looking for and find out that the file is written in PERL. On Virus Total we can also see the Dynamic DNS destinations that the malware uses to communicate to the C2C server.:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/cEkPpGw.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
19. Now we need to find the name of the attachment that was sent as a part of a phishing email. We know that the malicious file is a compressed zip file so to search for this we are going to look into the SMTP stream and look for any file ending in the “.zip” extension This will be fairly easy to find as we see the attached file named invoice.zip. :  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/2MhuhgF.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
20. If we would like to know the password of the zip file we can look at the same search and look within the email content. After a little bit of analyzing the content, we find the password to be 912345678.:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/kp0pRhW.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
21. We know that the Taedonggang APT uses SSL to encrypt their traffic, so if we want to know the SSL issuer we can conduct a search using the IP we found scanning a server. Here we can look at the interesting fields and find the ssl_issuer is “C = US”:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/kxa59v6.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
22. The Winsys32.dll file causes a file to be downloaded that would be usual for an American company. When doing the initial search you can see that the FTP client is running. After searching for it in the FTP stream and looking at the download load way, we see the file that was downloaded.:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/qXbwVk2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Splunk Searching Steps"/>
 <br />
<br />
23. The APT is known to create scheduled tasks to maintain persistence within  a system. Starting off we can search for the schtasks executable, and then pick up on anything that looks odd. Looking at the keypath “\\software\\microsoft\\network”  and the sourcetype winregistry we can find 4 items with base64 encoded text. Here we can see the Process.php being called several times.:  <br/>
